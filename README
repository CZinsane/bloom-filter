This ia an implementation of Bloom Filter, especially Counting Bloom Filter.

What is Bloom Filter?:
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter.


How to build and run the sample:
1. set up Simple Build Tool(http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)
2. run sbt
3. update
4. test 
5. doc (optional)
6. run <false positive prob. to set to the filter> <number of items>


Sample Scenario:
0.initialize a CountingBloomFilter with input max false positive probability and input expected number of items. 
1.add random distinct 2n(twice of your input) strings to the filter
2.discard n strings in added strings from the filter 
3.check that the filter contains each discarded string(i.e. measure false positive prob.). 
4.outputs false positive results and average execution times. 


Sample Scenario Outputs:

[Adding 200000 distinct random strings].......... done.
[Discarding 100000 strings].......... done.

[average time for discard] 0.006[ms] (average for 100000 times trials)

Sample Senario:
0.initialize a CountingBloomFilter with max false positive probability is 0.0001000 and expected number of items is 100000
1.add distinct random 200000 strings the filter (twice of your input)
2.discard 100000 strings of added (your input)
3.check that the filter contains each filter. (outputs only false positive results)
