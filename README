This ia an implementation of Bloom Filter, especially Counting Bloom Filter.

What is Bloom Filter?:
see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter.


How to build and run the sample:
1. set up Simple Build Tool(http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/)
2. run sbt
3. compile
4. doc (optional)
5. run <false positive probability to set to the filter>


Sample Scenario:
0.initialize a CountingBloomFilter with max false positive probability is %1.7f and expected number of item is 26^4(about 4.5*10^5) 
1.add all strings such that [a-z]^4 to the filter
2.discard all strings such that a[a-z]^3 from the filter
3.check that the filter contains each string. 
4.outputs false positive results and average execution times.

Test Senario:
0.initialize a CountingBloomFilter with max false positive probability is 0.0001000 and expected number of item is 26^4(about 4.5*10^5)
1.add all strings such that [a-z]^4 to the filter
2.discard all strings such that a[a-z]^3 from the filter
3.check that the filter contains each filter. (outputs only false positive results)
